# Intro to Sass

Since we are beginning to make larger websites, it makes sense to break up our projects into parts and extend functionality and reusability with Sass!

## What is Sass?
- Sass: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets
- Sass is a preprocessing language for CSS
    - There are many other preprocessor languages out there (LESS, Stylus, etc) 

As stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can help. Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other fun things. 
- It helps us develop CSS much more quickly and efficiently

### .sass versus .scss
There are two ways of writing Sass. Using the ```.sass``` extension and syntax or using the ```.scss``` extension and syntax.

When Sass first came out it used only the ```.sass``` extension - the syntax of which meant that you couldn't use ```;``` or ```{ }``` in the code itself, as the language relied on *indentation* only to be compiled properly. This was problematic for people with existing projects, that had tons of CSS - which meant less people were switching to using Sass. 

**The solution**

Sass then came out with the ```.scss``` extension which allowed for regular css to be placed in a ```.scss``` file. This meant for existing projects, only the files themselves have to be renamed.

## Benefits of using Sass
- Sass can concatenate and compress your styles for you, so you only have to attach one stylesheet and that means less requests to a server
- Variables in Sass make your code more consistent ( you can set up a particular set of colors at the beginning and use them throughout your project )
- Helps to make your code more modular, because you can break things down into smaller parts

## Setup
A ```.scss``` file is compiled into ```.css``` using a compiler. This compiler can be a command line tool like [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/) or it could be a GUI application like [Prepros](https://prepros.io/) or [Livereload](http://livereload.com/). A compiler looks for the ```.scss``` extension, and compiles any Sass files into CSS for us - usually on save, or when we run a compile command explicitly. 
```
.scss  ➡  compiler(Prepros/Jekyll)  ➡  .css
```

### File Structure & Partials
We usually break up our styling into modular parts, so that we can find things more easily, and make items reusable.

Your folder structure for a Sass project will look something like this: 
```
index.html
sass/
  └ style.scss
  └ _base.scss
  └ _mixins.scss
  └ components/
    └ _main.scss
css/
  └ style.css  ⬅︎ This file is generated by the compiler
```

#### Partials
 The sass directory contains what are called *partials*, which are .scss files that begin with an ```_``` (underscore). For example: ```_mixins.scss```, ```_base.scss```, and ```_main.scss``` are all partial files. 

#### Importing Partials
Partials are **imported** into our ```style.scss``` file using ```@import``` statements.

**style.scss**
```
@import 'base';
@import 'mixins';
@import 'components/main';
```

**You'll notice that the only file that is compiled into CSS is the ```style.scss```. This is the only file that the compiler will actually turn into ```style.css``` in this example because it's the only file that is not a partial.**
